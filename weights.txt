this is the some of the most important values to calculate in order 
Weakcount is the number of squares in Player A’s area that cannot be protected by Player A’s pawns.
For example, in Fig.4.2 the white player has 8 weak squares.
• Enemyknightonweak is the number of knights of Player B that are in the weak squares of Player A.
These weak squares are called outposts and best squares for knights because they can not be pushed
back by enemy pawns. For example, in Fig.4.2 the white player has 1 knight on outposts on d5
because d5 is a weak square for black.
• Centerpawncount is the number of pawns of Player A that are in squares e4,e5,d4 or d5. Center
pawns are important for controlling the center and decreasing enemy mobility. For example, in
Fig.4.2 the white player has 1 pawn in the center.
18
• Kingpawnshield is the number of pawns of Player A adjacent to Player A’s king. Pawn shield is
an important parameter for evaluating the king safety. For example, in Fig.4.2white king has 1
adjacent paw.
• Kingattacked is the material value of the pieces of the enemy that are acting on ones king’s adjacent
squares. For example, in Fig.4.2 the material value of the pieces of the black player’s pieces that
are acting on the white player’s king’s adjacent squares is 0.
• Kingdefended is the material value of the pieces of the Player A that are acting on Player A’s king’s
adjacent squares. For example, in Fig.4.2 the material value of the pieces of the white player’s
pieces that are acting on the white player’s king’s adjacent squares is the sum of the values of Queen,
2 Rooks and Knight.
• Kingcastled returns 1 if Player A is castled to measure king safety. For example, in Fig. 4.2white
king is castled.
• Bishopmob is the number of squares that a bishop can go to. This type of parameters are calculated
seperately for each bishop. For example, in Fig. 4.2the number of squares that the white bishop on
d2 can go is 5.
• Bishoponlarge parameter returns 1 if the bishop on the given square is one of the two large diagonals
of the board. Bishops are stronger on the large diagonals because they have higher mobility and
they are reaching the two central squares simultaneously controlling the center. For example, in Fig.
4.2the black bishop on c6 is on a large diagonal.
• Bishoppair returns 1 if Player A has two or more bishops. Bishop pairs are generally considered
an advantage as to bishops can together cover all possible squares regardless of the color of the
square. Bishop pairs are especially strong in open positions where there are no central pawns and
the bishops can move freely to create threats. For example, in Fig. 4.2black player has the bishop
pair.
• Knightmob is the number of squares that a specific knight can go to. For example, in Fig. 4.2the
number of squares that the white knight on f3 can go to is 5.
• Knightsupport returns 1 if a given knight on a given square is supported by ones own pawn.
Supported knights are strong because they can only be backfired by pawns and since they are
supported they can stay in an important position for a long number of moves making it harder for
the opponent to play around it. For example, in Fig. 4.2the knight on f3 is supported by a white
pawn.
• Knightperiphery0 returns 1 if a given knight is on the squares a1 to a8,a8 to h8,a1 to h1 or h1 to h8.
This is the outest periphery and most of the times knights on these squares are weaker. For example,
in Fig. 4.2the black knight on a6 is on periphery0.
• Knightperiphery1 returns 1 if a given knight is on the squares b2 to b7,b7 to g7,b2 to g2 or g2 to g7.
For example, in Fig. 4.2no knights are on periphery1.
19
• Knightperiphery2 returns 1 if a given knight is on the squares c3 to c6,c6 to f6,c3 to f3 or f3 to f6.
For example, in Fig. 4.2the white knight on f3 is on periphery2.
• Knightperiphery3 returns 1 if a given knight is on the squares e4, e5,d4 or d5. For example, in Fig.
4.2the white knight on d5 is on periphery3.
• Isopawn returns 1 if a given pawn has no neighboring pawns of the same color. Isolated pawns
are generally considered as a weakness since they cannot be protected by pawns so they should be
protected by other more valuable pieces. For example, in Fig. 4.2the pawn on e4 is isolated.
• Doublepawn returns 1 if a pawn is doubled pawn. Doubled pawns are considered a disadvantage as
they blocked each other and they are vulnerable to attacks. For example, in Fig. 4.2the black pawns
on the c-column are doubled.
• Passpawn returns 1 if for a given pawn there are no opposing pawns of the enemy on the neighboring
columns and on the given pawn’s column ahead of the pawn. If a pawn is passed it is big threat for
the opponent because the are no pawns on the way to prevent it from promoting. For example, in
Fig. 4.2white pawn on a4 is a passed pawn.
• Rookbhdpasspawn returns 1 if a rook of the same color is behind the passed pawn. If there is a rook
behind a passed pawn it is easier to push to pawn forward as it is always protected by the rook and
rook never gets in the way. For example, in Fig. 4.2the white pawn on a4 is passed and defended by
the rook on a1.
• Backwardpawn returns 1 if the neighboring pawns of a pawn are ahead of it. Backward pawns are
the last pawn of a pawn chain and even though they are not isolated they can not be defended easily.
So they are considered a disadvantage. For example, in Fig. 4.2the white pawn on g2 is a backward
pawn.
• Rankpassedpawn is the rank of the passed pawn. A passed pawn on rank 7 which means the pawn
is one move away from promoting is a lot more dangerous compared to a passed pawn on its
initial square. Passed pawns with higher ranks have higher priority thus they are an advantage. For
example, in Fig. 4.2the a4 pawns rank is 4.
• Blockedpawn returns 1 if a central pawn on column e or d on its initial square is blocked by its own
piece which severely decreases the mobility of the pieces. In Fig. 4.2there are no blocked pawns.
• Blockedpassedpawn returns 1 if a passed pawn of Player A is blocked by a piece of Player B which
prevents it from moving closer to promotion. This is an advantage for the blocking side. The passed
pawn on a4 is not blocked by any black pieces. If it is pushed to a5 however it will be considered
blocked because there is a black knight on a6.
• Rookopenfile returns 1 if a given rook is on a file with no pawns from either side. Rooks are stronger
on open columns because they can move freely. For example, in Fig. 4.2the black rook on b2 in on
an open file.
• Rooksemiopenfile returns 1 if a given rook is on a file with no pawns from its own side. Rooks are
strong on semi-open files as well. For example, in Fig. 4.2the white rook on f1 is on a semi open
file.
20
• Rookclosedfile returns 1if a given rook is on a file with pawns from both sides. Rooks on closed
files are considered a disadvantage as they have lower file mobility and no access to the important
squares of the game especially in the middlegame and endgame.
• Rookonseventh returns 1 if a given rook is on seventh rank from the Players perspective. For white
that would be the rank 7 for black rank 2. Rooks on seventh rank are dangerous and a classical
theme in chess for creating major threats at once. For example, in Fig. 4.2the black rook on b2 in
on the seventh rank.
• Rookmob returns the number of squares a rook can move to. For example, in Fig. 4.2the black rook
on b2 has a mobility value of 9.
• Rookcon returns 1 if there are no pieces between to rooks of the same color and they are on the
same file or on the same rank. Connected rooks defend each other to create threats in the opposition
area because they cannot be captured by queen or king. For example, in Fig. 4.2the whites rooks
are connected.
• Queenmob returns the number of squares a queen can move to.
• Pawn value is the number of pawns of the Player A. These parameters are the simple material count
parameters.
• Knight value is the number of knights of the Player A.
• Bishop value is the number of bishops of the Player A.
• Rook value is the number of rooks of the Player A.
• Queen value is the number of queens of the Player A.
These evaluation parameters try to catch the subtleties of chess besides basic factors.
